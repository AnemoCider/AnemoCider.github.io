Hi there! This is Junwen Yu. 

I'm currently a Junior student from University of Michigan. I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science and interested in Game Development & Computer Graphics. My goal is to create photo-realistic virtual worlds with real-time complexity.

You may find tech-related blogs at the <a href="/work">work page</a>. 

You can also view some of my casual posts at the <a href="/">main page</a> (some of them are in Chinese though). 

Feel free to leave a message at the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. Hope you enjoy your visit!
