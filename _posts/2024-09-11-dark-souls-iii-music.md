# Storytelling in video game music

**An analysis of Dark Souls III soundtrack.**

## Introduction

Dark Souls III is one of my first AAA video games. It's an action role-playing game, where the player will travel through a dying world, beat powerful enemies, and finally decide the destiny of the world. The overall feeling is desparate - the main character is lonely and weak, while most of your enemies were once great heros, and now become corrupted or insane. What's more, you will eventually discover that the world, once grand and prosperous, is now doomed to die.

Most pieces from the soundtrack are for Boss fight, and all stick to the style of the game - dark, intense, epic, and sometimes even desparate. Typical elements within these pieces are the violin (including cello), the brass, the church bell, and chorus.

## Immersive storytelling with the Music

For role-playing games like Dark Souls III, immersive storytelling is an important part of the game experience. To achieve this goal, designers would usually create the atmosphere through various approaches, and the music always has a crucial effect on it. 

From my gameplay experience with Dark Souls III, the tracks themselves are excellent storytellers. Let's take the boss fight pieces as an example, as they comprise the majority of the soundtrack. In the first place, all the boss fights are intense and take place within the dark and desperate world, so the pieces usually give the player some pressure. Besides this, each boss fight tends to have a specific style, and the music that accompanies would develop uniquely, bringing different feelings. Due to such variety, even without seeing the boss himself, the player should already have a sense of what the fight will be like. Besides this, all the pieces still follow the uniform style across the game, such that the player would also feel that a fierce battle is unraveling.

When fighting with a giant boss, the music conveys a powerful sense of urgency and tension, with stirring bass vocals and drum beats, and incessant violin and soprano that comes in a bit later. 

Yhorm the Giant, 2:18 to 2:32

On the other hand, some enemies tend to be mysterious, elegant, but dangerous still, which is accompanied by an ethereal and haunting music. The soprano and violin interwine in a dissonant way, and the distant drums and sound effect of the enemy's footsteps make the music even more terrifying.

Dancer of the Boreal Valley, 1:36 to 1:56

There are heroes that have been trapped by their task for decades, and as a player I will eventually end their incessant journey. In this battle, the music somewhat resembles a requiem, with the bass vocal telling the enemies' story in a gloomy mood, and saprano and the violin mourning their harsh life. It was not an easy fight, and I could have used some tricks to make the battle way smoother. However, as soon as I heard the music, I decided to fight in the traditional way, as a respect to the heroic enemies.

Abyss Watchers, 1:37 to 1:53

<href><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Gs2Y7mt5Pk?si=s_63aBAOHONypCf0&amp;start=97" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></href>

Towards the end of the game, instead of feeling relieved, I started to question whether the whole journey meant anything: after defeating so many powerful and heroic enemies, am I truly ready to take on their responsibilities and save this desperate world? 

And then it comes to the final bass fight. The gameplay itself isn't quite unique, but the music renders it a completely special mood. In the first stage, the bass vocal leads a grand movement, which encourages the player to devote all himself into the tough battle with resolution. However, in the second stage, the piano part emerges and keeps playing a gentle and dim melody. Eventually the exciting vocal disappears, leaving the piano lonely towards the end, which exactly describes what the player would feel after this battle.

I have mentioned the two stage nature of this boss fight. It is a typical practice for video game music to transit to a different style across stages of a battle. Thus, the player has gained some control over the music, and such interaction also helps with the immersive storytelling a lot, for the atmosphere is built upon the music, and now the music transits under the player's control, which brings the player further into the game world.

Dark Souls III is no short of such transitions, and here are just two of my favorite examples:

Champion's Gravetender, 1:43 to 2:13

Slave Knight Gael, 1:31 to 2:23

## The main theme

I've talked about so many great boss fight pieces, and how they contributed to the storytelling. However, my favorite piece is actually the main theme. The reason is that it perfectly describes and summarizes what I feel from this game. It might be a little exaggerated, but now, as an experienced player, I really feel that I don't have to enter the game anymore - I could get the same thing by just lingering on the main menu and listening to the main theme over and over again. The music itself is a story, and it accurately elicits the proper feelings. 

What's more, it has been my wake-up music ever since I completed the game. Everyday I wake up as if I were to fight against the toughest enemies in the world.

0:00 to 0:13

At the very beginning, we hear a church bell. This is interesting, because in the game, our character would also be awaken by a toll of the bell. It is a clear delineation of the boundary between the reality and the game world: from this point onwards, the player starts off a grand adventure.

The bell is followed by the mezzo-soparno. The vocal stays at each key for seconds, which feels like the flat narration of the context, like the "Once upon a time" stuff found at the beginning of traditional adventure stories.

0:14 to 0:28

Then the narration continues, but this time the brass start to come in at the deep layer, while the saprano leads the melody in the higher range, which gradually unfolds the world and the story.

0:28 to 1:02

Till this point, the melody is relatively calm and peaceful. However, as the violin joins, it quickly turns into a mixture of epic and sad feeling. What I especially love about this part is the smooth transition between the violin and the saprano. What I feel is that the saprano builds up to the climax of the music with great intensity, and the violin part serves as a buffer period so that the emotions won't burst too rapidly.

1:03 to 1:28

The cello and the church bell work together, further unfolding the story and build up towards the next climax.

1:29 to 1:55

The tune suddenly turns towards the bass part, which becomes anxious and intense. It feels like the boss's attack becomes intense, and the player is making all attempts to fight back. Then the saprano joins and pushes the music to the climax again, which feels like the boss becomes insane, 

1:55 to 2:45 (the end)

The reflection after the boss fight. The lonely solo of the violin, and later the saprano, forms a strong contrast with the epic or intense parts. It expresses the feeling of extreme sadness, which sounds like the despair of being unable to beat the enemies, and more importantly, the sense of emptiness that follows. I believe it's such a feeling that lasts so long after after I complete this game, making the music an unforgetabble piece to me.
